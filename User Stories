1.As a user I would like a dice game that allows me to compete with another player in a Deathmatch.  
I would also like a system that allows me to view my score rank with respect to other players and past games. 

2.As a user I would like to be able to register my nickname in the game system before I begin playing. 

3.As a user I would like a game that allows me to play repetitively as many times as I want.  
To exit the game I would like to hit a quit button.

4.As a Manager I would like a system that allows me to view the ranks of players from past games.
