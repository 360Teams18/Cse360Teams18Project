1. As a player I would like a dice game that allows me to race another player in an airplane race.  I would also like a system that 
allows me to view my score in terms of number of wins in comparison to other players of past games.

2. As a player I would like to I would like a game that allows me to play repetitively as many times as I want.

3. As a player I would like a game that has at least 3 dynamic rules that effect the speed and performance of the airplane.  These
should give an advantage to a player depending on what they roll. Perhaps one rule could determine when a player is able to start moving.
Another could determine whether or not an airplane gets stalled.  Furthermore, a rule could include the ability of an airplane to double 
its speed during the race.

4. As a score viewer I would like a system that allows me to update and view my game score rank with respect to players from 
past games.  The system should be convienient and easy to use.  Perhaps it could be implemented in a system that is separate from
the game itself.
