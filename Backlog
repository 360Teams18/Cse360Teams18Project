NOTE: In order to run properly the program must have the text file named 'stats.txt'.

Problem Description(based on the user stories): 
    We are to make an airplane race game with at least 3 dynamic rules which confer an advantage to a player 
depending on the value of the dice that they roll. Furthermore our game must have a system to allow a user to 
record and view their score statistics to players from past games.

Priorities:
1. Implement classes representing a Dice and a Player.  -Task completed
2. Implement a JPanel class called AirplanePanel to have an GUI for the game. -Task completed
3. Implement a statistic recording system. -Task completed

Dependencies:
1. The functionality of the game's rules depend on the implementation of the Dice and Player classes.
2. The aesthetic features involving the looks of the game depend on the JPanel descendant class AirplanePanel.
3. The statistics viewing feature depends on the implementation of the AirplanePanel class.

Note: A 20 sided dice is used for this game.

Rules:
1. If dice roll is divisible by 3 your airplane can begin moving.
2. If you roll the same number twice your current speed for your airplane is doubled.
3. If you roll a 1 or a 20 your plane 'stalls' and your speed reduces to 0.
4. Rule 1 is used to determine if you can begin moving again if your plane 'stalls'.

Win Condition: A player's plane crosses the finishline.
