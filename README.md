#### Description: 
The objective is to apply software engineering principals in the creation of a project.  This project will be a simple dice game, which allows users to record their statistics, and see other users’ statistics.  The game should have win and lose conditions, and a minimum of 3 rules. Additionally, it should have a point or scoring system for ranking players.  Users should be able to view their statistics, as well as the statistics of other players.   
The project is composed of three sprints, ending 4/1, 4/15, and 4/29.  Sprint deliverables are due by 11:59pm on their respective day.

####Grading Criteria:
Grading is dependent on the following criteria:
•	Usability
•	Complexity
•	Fidelity to project description
•	Congruency between code and documentation
Points will be deducted for overly simplistic implementations.  For example, a text based game with only 1 die would loss points based on lack of complexity and usability.

####Week 1:  25%
- [x]	Set up GitHub environment
- [x]	Commit documents: minimum of use case diagram, and user stories, feature backlog
- [x]	Each person should commit at least once, to show they are able to access the repository
- [x]	Only documentation is required at this point

####Rubric for Week 1:
•	User Stories:  10 pts
•	Use Case Diagram: 10 pts
•	GitHub: 3 pts
•	Backlog: 2 pts

####Week 2 – 3: 37%

- [x]		50% of the backlog features should be complete
- [x]		Documentation should be updated to reflect any changes made during the development cycle and include build/play instructions
- [x]		Code should compile without errors
- [x]	  Unit tests for implemented features

####Rubric for Week 2-3:
•	Documentation: 10 pts
•	Unit Tests: 15 pts
•	Working Code: 12 pts

####Week 4 – 5: 38%
- [ ]		100% of backlog features should be complete
- [ ]		A minimum of the project description should be implemented
